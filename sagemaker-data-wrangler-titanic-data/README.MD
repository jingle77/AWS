# Perform EDA and Feature Engineering on the Titanic Dataset with Sagemaker Data Wrangler

## Project
Sagemaker Data Wrangler is a service that allows the end user to visualize, analyze, and transform data with very little coding or none at all. In this project, we will use a sample dataset within the tool and go through the process of preparing data for a supervised machine-learning problem. I should also note that Data Wrangler can also import data from various AWS services as well as other 3rd party tools

#### Tools Used: Sagemaker Data Wrangler
