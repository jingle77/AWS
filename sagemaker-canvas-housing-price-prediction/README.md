# Predict Housing Prices with Sagemaker Canvas

## Project
Sagemaker Canvas is an AWS service that allows the end user to build a machine-learning model with no code. It is a practical way for someone with little to no experience with machine learning to get started and/or experience Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers to quickly build a model. In this project, we will utilize one of the sample datasets in Sagemaker Canvas to build a model that predicts housing prices.
