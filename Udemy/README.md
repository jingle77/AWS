# AWS SageMaker Practical for Beginners | Build 6 Projects
My work on the 6 projects outlined in this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-aws-sagemaker-6-real-world-case-studies/learn/lecture/21110086#overview). This course is led by Dr. Ryan Ahmed of the SuperDataScience Team. Links to the individual projects and descriptions are listed below.

* Project #1: Train, test and deploy simple regression model to predict employeesâ€™ salary using AWS SageMaker Linear Learner
* Project #2: Train, test and deploy a multiple linear regression machine learning model to predict medical insurance premium.
* Project #3: Train, test and deploy a model to predict retail store sales using XGboost regression and optimize model hyperparameters using SageMaker Hyperparameters tuning tool.
* Project #4: Perform Dimensionality reduction Using SageMaker built-in PCA algorithm and build a classifier model to predict cardiovascular disease using XGBoost Classification model.
* Project #5: Develop a traffic sign classifier model using Sagemaker and Tensorflow.
* Project #6: Deep Dive in AWS SageMaker Studio, AutoML, and model debugging.
